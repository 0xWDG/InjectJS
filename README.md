# Inject Javascript
Safari Extension

Hi, so, you want to Inject Javascript to a website?
Great.

Since this is a very basic (demo) project it has not that many options.

### How to install?
- Build this project.
- Run on your device.
- Enable extension in Safari (iOS 15+).
- Enable full access.

### How to use?
- Open "InjectJS" Settings
- Fill in the javascript field (press *DONE* on keyboard, otherwise it will _not_ save)
- Reload the page

### Examples
To make a script to only run on a pre-defined domain, use the function `domain("domainname.ext", function)` (Warning, `"domainname.ext"` will be converted to a regular expression using `new RegExp("domainname.ext")`).

For the rest, there are no (known) limitations.

Run on "Domain.com"
```JavaScript
domain("domain.com", function() {
     // .. run this
})
```

Run on "WDGWV.com" and "WDGWV.nl".
```JavaScript
domain("wdgwv.(com|nl)", function() {
    alert('Hi There!')
})
```

### Future goals
- <a href='https://github.com/wdg/InjectJS/issues/1' target='_blank'>Built-in Javascript validator, if there's a fault in your code, it will not execute, and does not throw a error.</a>
- <a href='https://github.com/wdg/InjectJS/issues/2' target='_blank'>Add a in-extension settings for managing different websites, now you'll need to use `domain(...)` for specific domains.</a>

### Extra
Thanks for using, feel free to create issues, pull requests, any help is appreciated.
